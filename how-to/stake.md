## **G**overnance

The LOOP Token ($LOOP) is Loop Finance's native governance token. The first and foremost functionality of the token allows holders to participate in governance on the protocol. Users can deposit LOOP tokens to create governance polls, and LOOP stakers can vote to decide on community grants protocol updates, and parameter changes.
